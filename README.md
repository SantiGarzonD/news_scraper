<h1>La Republica (news) Python Web Scraper<h1>

Welcome! I made this program in order to practice WebScraping.
It is a great skill with infinite applications.
My program extracts 5 itmes:

1. Home Page News Urls

And from those Urls we extract the other 4 items:

2. Title of the news
3. Author of the news
4. Summary of the news
5. Body of the news

I wanna thank Platzi for teaching me this and having this program as a final project from the Basic WebScraping course.

Hope it is helpful to you.
